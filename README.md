# Extract_Number_From_String_Using_VBA_Excel-
To extract numbers from a text string in Excel using VBA, you can create a custom function that processes each character in the string, identifies numeric characters, and concatenates them to form the complete number. Here's how you can implement this:

1.Open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Editor:
Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
In the editor, click on Insert > Module to create a new module.
Insert the VBA Code.

2.Copy and paste ExtractNumberFromwString file code into the module.

3.Save and Close the VBA Editor:
Press Ctrl + S to save your work.
Close the VBA editor by clicking the X or pressing Alt + Q.

4.Use the Function in Excel:
In your Excel worksheet, you can now use the ExtractNumberFromString function as a regular Excel function. For example:
=ExtractNumberFromString(A1)
This will extract the numeric portion from the text in cell.
